{{< figure src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4084738/212545495-ed43f706-3bc3-4a3d-a1ce-5e7ca5e5e552.png >}}

## 1: Content Area
It's the web content part. There's no traditional address bar on top of the App. If you want to change the url, or search anything on the internet, please click on the web title area in toolbar on the bottom of the screen.

## 2: Toolbar
From left to right, the explanation is as follows:

* **Web Title/Address bar**

  When web is loaded, the title will be displayed here. Click on this area if you want to input url or search keywords in search engine. (The default search engine is Google. You can change it in Settings)

* **Bookmarks**

  Show the bookmark list. If you want to add current web into bookmarks, you can click right most button (`Menu`), and click on `Save as bookmark` button.

  >**Long Click**: add current web url into bookmarks.

* **Tab Count**

  The number in the square means how many tabs are open now. Click on the button, the tab list would be displayed. From left to right, the buttons mean: `new incognito tab`, `web history`, `tab list`, and `new tab` and `close panel`.
